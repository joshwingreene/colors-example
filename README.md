This is a React Native app that I used to get an understanding of Redux and how I could integrate Realm in order to get offline data persistence. 

This app shows a grid of colors. When you click on a color, it shows it and gives you the ability to save it.

**Important:** The most recent code is on the realmAndReduxOffline branch.

**Extra:** I changed the Airtable API key. The one in the repo will no longer work.
